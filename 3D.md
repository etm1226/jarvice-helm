# Accelerated 3D Remote Display Capabilities

## Overview

JARVICE supports running 3D applications using GPU acceleration on servers or cloud instances.  This allows users to run complex rendering applications, such as pre and post processing tools, with good performance and compatibility despite being rendered remotely.  This does not require any advanced hardware capabilities on clients themselves - simply a web browser or VNC client is needed to access, as with 2D applications.  The user experience is also transparent and requires no additional setup once the initial administrator-level configuration is done.

## Supported Software and Hardware Configuration

At the time of this writing, the following configurations support 3D graphics acceleration in JARVICE:

### Hardware

- NVIDIA GPUs with EGL capabilities, capable of using the NVIDIA driver 390 or higher; 450 or higher is recommended.

#### Notes
1. Non-NVIDIA GPU types are not currently supported but may be in the future.

### Compute node/instance

- x86 Linux host
- NVIDIA GPU driver version 390 or higher; 450 or higher is recommended
- NVIDIA container runtime, latest version recommended; configured as default container runtime
- Working `nvidia-smi` command on the host, at least 1 GPU available

#### Notes
1. Non-x86 platforms are not currently supported but may be in the future.
2. AWS instance types capable of running the `amazon-eks-gpu-node-*` AMI for the Kubernetes version used for an EKS deployment are supported.

### Kubernetes

- To use this feature, pods must be allowed to mount (read-only) host paths into containers in the "jobs" namespace; JARVICE manages this securely and automatically, and said paths are only available to *initContainers* rather than the application itself, but this capability must not be disabled if this feature is to be used
- The JARVICE `jarvice-dri-optional-device-plugin` *DaemonSet* must be deployed, which is the default in [values.yaml](values.yaml) (controlled via `daemonsets.dri_optional.enabled`, which defaults to `true`)

### Applications

All graphical applications provided in the default JARVICE service catalog support this capability if enabled.  Custom applications must use [image-common](https://github.com/nimbix/image-common) and must inherit from a CentOS 7 (e.g. `FROM centos:7` in `Dockerfile`) or Ubuntu 18.04 (e.g. `FROM ubuntu:bionic` in `Dockerfile`) base image, which support the vendor-neutral GL libraries (`libglvnd`).
